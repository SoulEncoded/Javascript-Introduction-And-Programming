# Javascript Introduction And Programming

In this section I will highlight the structure for the Soul Encoded Javascript tutorials. I hope you are ready to get your feet wet into some real programming.

## Brief Javascript Introduction

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted language with first-class functions.
first-class functions means that the language supports passing functions as arguments to other functions,
returning them as the values from other functions, and assigning them to variables or storing them in data structures.

For Web Development I would say that Javascript is the king at the current moment. Javascript essentially runs the web. It may not be the most safe, fast, or pretty language to write in, but If you want to get into to web development, you will need to learn Javascript.

NOTE: there are other languages and ways to make a website, but for our Soul Encoded projects we will focus on Javascript. Therefore, I highly recommend getting a strong foundational understand of Javascript. It will help you out greatly in the future.

## Programming vs Programming Languages

Most people will tell you that it doesn't matter which programming language you learn, because the programming concepts are what is truly important.
I didn't understand this statement at first, but I somewhat agree now.

- Programming Concepts: are a collection of methodologies that are shared throughout may programming languages and frameworks.

- Programming Languages: are a collection of keywords that are mapped to a set of instructions for the computer to output.

This probably doesn't make that much sense, but think of programming concepts as a thing that needs to get done, and the programming language as the tool to get the job done.

For Example, you will learn about Variable Declaration.

The programming concept for variable declaration would be creating a place holders for data to be stored.

In Javascript it would look like this `var data = 1;` but in Python it would look like this `data = 1`

Notice that in Javascript there is the keyword `var` which stands for variable. This is because in Javascript the `var` keyword is mapped to a specific instruction and in python `var` is not part of the language. However, both lines of code essentially does the same thing.

Therefore, what most people say about learning the concepts vs a language is true, but I highly recommend you to focus on one language for a while.

Having a deeper understanding of one language is better than having a surface level understanding of 100 languages.

## Course Material

Below is a free book and tools that you will need to complete the Soul Encoded Javascript Challenges.

- [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/): This is a awesome JS book that you can view for free. Consider supporting them by buying a physical copy
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/): You can just follow the install or instead us [homebrew](https://brew.sh/). We will be using Node to run your javascript files.
- [Atom](https://atom.io/): We will be using Atom to write our code. here is a quick lesson on [IDEs]([IDE](https://github.com/SoulEncoded/IDE))

## Course Structure

For the Javascript Section of the Soul Encoded Project, we will be going over the Eloquent Javascript book.
The basic format will be the following:
- Lecture based on the book material.
- Challenges that demonstrates what we learned.

Basically the material will be there for you to consume, and it will be up to you to put in the time and effort to learn this stuff. Good Luck and have some fun with it :)

## Challenge

1. [Read Intro to Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/00_intro.html).
2. [Get your IDE setup e.a. install Atom](https://github.com/SoulEncoded/IDE).
3. [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).
4. create a file called `hello_world.js`.
5. in `hello_world.js` type in `console.log('hello world');`.
6. run the `hello_world.js` file with Node.

NOTE: I purposely did not include interactive learning sites. e.a. sites that has a code editor and you solve challenges.
I generally find them not as helpful to your learning in the long run. I want you to get used to working with command line, git, github, and other tools that you would use everyday as an engineer.
